		AdvancedRocketry 1.12.2-1.5.0-130-UNSTABLE build -130 for 1.12.2:
			 Highly untested and may break world

			Current release 1.12.2-1.5.0-130

			 * [ fix crafting issue with iron rods, #1517](https://github.com/zmaster587/AdvancedRocketry/commit/60e150fe84bf963)
			 * [ fix typo, closes #1516](https://github.com/zmaster587/AdvancedRocketry/commit/7440732cbfd1b1a)

	Building Gadgets (went from BuildingGadgets v2.4.6 to BuildingGadgets v2.6.4):
		BuildingGadgets v2.6.4:
			 * Drastically improved rendering performance of Destruction Gadget in Connected Area mode when set to a large area
		BuildingGadgets v2.6.3:
			Fixed a server side crash.

			Fixed the yellow box rendering around chests to always render if the tool is in your hand, not only when other renders are occurring (Like if you're looking at nothing).
		BuildingGadgets v2.6.2:
			* Adds surface mode to the building gadget, and renames the exchanging gadget's 'wall' mode to 'surface' for consistency.
			* [x] Applies fuzzy mode to the building/destruction gadgets, and separates out the fuzzy mode toggling from the undo keybind into its own keybind.
			* [x] Adds means of setting connected area mode for building/exchanging/destruction gadgets (referred to as 'connected surface' for the building/exchanging gadgets), and makes it default to true.
			* [x] Fixes a longstanding bug where relative up/down directions are inverted when interacting with the bottom sides of blocks.
			* [x] Allows clicking a mode in the radial menu GUI to change it without having to close the GUI.
			* [x] Allows the slice in the GUI for the gadget's currently selected mode to render green with green text.
			* [x] Changes the GUI circle to a torus, and requires the cursor to be on its surface to select a mode.
			* [x] Replaced standard MC 'click' sounds with custom 'beep' sounds for GUI operations.
			* [x] Adds togglable buttons to the GUI to change values currently only toggled with keybinds.
			* [x] Given the above, the newly added 'fuzzy' and 'connected area' keybinds are set to NONE, so as to reduce excessive conflicts that modpack users will have to resolve.

			* [x] Yellow box around bound inventories

			* [x] Shift Right Click an existing bound inventory to un-bind it.
		BuildingGadgets v2.6.1:
			Added the ability to bind inventories to Refined Storage Interfaces.

			Misc bugfixes.
		BuildingGadgets v2.6.0:
			Bind any tool to a chest - Sneak-Right click any tool on any chest (Including modded chests) to bind it. The tool will pull items out of that chest now. Thanks @Phylogeny for helping with the rendering portions of this!!

			Updated configs to the new forge way, which means you can change your config options from in-game. Go to the mod options button and search for building gadgets. Thanks @MajorTuvok for this PR! :)

			Misc bug fixes.

			Please let me know if you run into anything weird!
		BuildingGadgets v2.5.0:
			This release sees a few minor bug fixes and issues with the copy tool failing to copy an area.

			It also features a rather significant refactor effort made by the community. Shoutout to MichaelHillcox and Phylogeny and
			MajorTuvok for all the help with suggestions and making the mod cleaner and easier to read! :) I flagged this as beta due to the fact there are MAJOR refactors in the code. I did a good amount of testing and didn't find too many bugs, but I wanted to flag it as beta until its been tested a bit more :).
