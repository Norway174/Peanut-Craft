			-Blocked right click interaction with GuardianCrystals to prevent them from being picked up by things like soul vials.

			 slightly more then Overworld ore. Players can exploit this using any ore converter to converting stacks of end ore to overworld ore.

			!!! BACKUP YOUR WORLDS BEFORE UPDATING !!!

			With support for 1.13.x coming soon, I've made the first step and flattened all my blocks and items. This are the blocks/items affected:

			- Yellorite ore, Benitoite ore, Anglesite ore
			- Yellorium / Cyanite / Graphite / Blutonium / Ludicrite / Steel metal blocks (and their item forms)
			- Yellorium / Cyanite / Graphite / Blutonium / Ludicrite / Steel ingots and dusts
			- Benitoite and Anglesite crystals

			If you have those items in chests/storage/machines other then vanillas one YOU MUST move them to vanilla chests before updating or you end up loosing them.

			Many mods do not use the system vanilla have in place to address this kind of changes. Iron Chests form the Iron Chest mod are OK (if you are using version 1.12.2-7.0.59.842 or newer of Iron Chest the other chest types should be OK too)

			The full changelog is following

	Mouse Tweaks (went from [1.12.2] Mouse Tweaks 2.9 to [1.12.2] Mouse Tweaks 2.10):
		[1.12.2] Mouse Tweaks 2.10:
			 * Added a new setting for switching between "smooth scrolling, minor issues" and "non-smooth scrolling, no issues", set to smooth scrolling by default. The second option fixes a number of issues where Mouse Tweaks seemingly scrolls "through" another mod's GUI (namely JEI): [1](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/issues/2), [2](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/issues/17), [3](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/mouse-tweaks/files/19). Unfortunately, enabling the second option also makes the item scrolling a little non-smooth. Considering that the aforementioned issues require rather specific conditions to trigger and aren't very impactful, while scrolling items is something you do all the time and want the experience to be as good as possible, the setting was left at "smooth scrolling" by default. Huge thanks to [@mezz](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/members/mezz) for [contributing the fix](https://github.com/YaLTeR/MouseTweaks/pull/20) and explaining the underlying input mechanics.
			 * Fixed Mouse Tweaks clicking "through" some mods' GUIs (namely JEI): read above for details. The fix is active regardless of the smooth/non-smooth scrolling setting value.
			 * Added tooltips to all settings in the Forge Mod Options menu.

	Tinkers Construct (went from TConstruct-1.12.2-2.11.0.106.jar to TConstruct-1.12.2-2.12.0.115.jar):
		TConstruct-1.12.2-2.12.0.115.jar:
			The last release introduced a bug that made the Tinker Tank unusable. Now it can be used again!
		TConstruct-1.12.2-2.12.0.113.jar:
			Added several checks to alloy recipes, to prevent startup if there are recipes that don't make sense and might break the game/crash. Things like vanishing fluids and/or crashes when certain liquids are in the smeltery should no longer happen with this, BUT it might be that existing mods might not start anymore, if they add broken recipes!

			 *
			Tanks/Gauges/Windows now show their contained fluid in item form again!

			 *
			Illagers now also melt into emeralds

			 *
			Display no fuel in Smeltery JEI recipe if there exists no fuel that can melt the block/item

			 *
			Several TiC furnace recipes now give XP! Like.. grout!

			 *
			Add a (very) short cooldown to rapier backpedal

			 *
			Use white glass background for clear item frame, since it's invisible with some texture packs

			 *
			Congealed slime blocks now only keep you bouncing if you land on them with a minimum speed, to prevend jittering when standing/walking on them

			 *
			Fix a weird smeltery bug where items that can't melt mess with fuel consumption or provide infinite fuel

			 *
			Add a few checks to advancements, to prevent potential crashes and/or unnecessary lag

			 *
			Fixed invalid smeltery configuration that would allow to have a smeltery controller on the floor level, which could couse crashes

			 *
			Fixes an issue where fluids are non-default then get switched to default on world load, but never had their texture loaded. You typically did not notice it with Tinkers fluids since we have so many that one is almost gaurenteed to be default, but better to be on the safe side

			 *
			Updated german localization

	Tiny Progressions (went from tinyprogressions-1.12.2-3.3.31-Release.jar to Tiny Progressions v3.3.32 (1.12.2)):
		Tiny Progressions v3.3.32 (1.12.2):

	TorchMaster (went from torchmaster_1.12.2-1.6.4.62.jar to torchmaster_1.12.2-1.7.1.74.jar):
		torchmaster_1.12.2-1.7.1.74.jar:
			v1.7.1

			 * FIX: Fixed an issue with the Feral Flare Lantern that could lead to chunk corruption when placed close to the world height limit.
			 *  NEW: Added a configuration option to limit the amount of lights a Feral Flare Lantern can place.
			 * Warning: Setting this value in conjunction with the radius and light level setting too high can still lead to chunk corruption! Dont be stupid. You dont need a light at every possible block in a chunk.
			v1.7.0

			 * CHANGE: The Mega Torch and Dread Lamp now work in a cube instead of a cylinder. This should make it much easier to setup torches without overlap or deadspots. The Size of the cube is Range + 1 in each direction. A range of 64 (default) will result in a cube of 129 by 129 blocks with the torch as its center.
			 * NEW [Beta]: Mega Torches can now visualize the range at which they work. Use any dye to render a visual representation of the torches working volume. Use any dye or an empty hand to disable the renderer. The renderer will also disable itself when you change dimensions or get out of viewing range.
			 * NEW: Feral Flare Lanterns can now be configured to only place lights in line of sight. Simply rightclick the lantern to open the gui. At the moment this mechanic feels a bit clunky, so there will be changes in a future release.
			 * NEW: Mega Torches should now be able to suppress those scary cave ambient sounds
			v1.6.4

			 * FIX: reworked torch storage system to use capabilities instead of a global file. This fixes an issue with torches not working in most modded dimensions after a restart. You might need to replace your torches and lamps for the changes to take effect.
			v1.6.3

			 * FIX: Moved russian language files to correct location
			v1.6.2

			 * Updated to latest stable MCForge Version (14.23.3.2655)
			 * FIX: Feral Flare Lantern now uses the configuration option for its tick rate
			 * FIX: Torches should no longer work across multiple world saves
			 * FIX: Added small workaround to prevent a crash during world startup on certain modpacks
			 * FIX: Improved Terrain lighter compatibility with replaceable blocks
			 * CHANGE: Removed some Logging Spam (and added more :D well, just for some errors)
			v1.6.1

			 * Fix Mega Torch and Dread Lamp not working (oops...)
			v1.6.0

			 * Switched torchmaster logging to debug instead of info to reduce log spam
			v1.5.0

			 * Added beginner tooltips to the mega torch, dread lamp and terrain lighter
			 * Added persistent torch registry (Allows torches and lamps to work while not being chunk loaded)
			 * MC 1.12 versions of this mod are now signed, yey!
			v1.4.3

			 * Updated to forge 14.21.0.2363, fixes a crash on startup due to the forge registry changes.
