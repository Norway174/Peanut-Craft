			Woops, I broke it. Dank Nulls now work again with some other nice improvements for one of the final 1.12.2 versions. This version comes with some rewrites on the inventory system so please post any issues to the [Building Gadgets Github](https://github.com/Direwolf20-MC/BuildingGadgets/issues/new/)

			 * Rewrote how the Gadgets insert items back into the inventories, It now follows in the extracting systems footsteps and flows from the Linked inventory to the Players inventory and finally looking for any inventory bound inventories (Dank Null) 
			 * Added the Astral Sorcery Flare to the blacklist by default as it causes some odd issues with the Copy Paste Gadget. Fixed

			 * Fixed the Dank Null support that I removed by accident.. Woops, sorry about that. 
			 * Fixed the Gadgets being able to build above the world height (and below) 
			 * Fixed the Gadgets being able to select our Effect Block (The one that shrinks and grows). This was mostly an issue in Creative.

			Changed

			 * Rewrote the way we extract items from inventories. We now have an actual defined flow of Remote / Bound inventory then Player inventory. This also fixes some weird issues with having partly enough items in one or the other inventory. Fixed

			 * Fixed a pretty major dupe bug using the exchanger and some DireDurps! (Huge thanks to [dh458](https://github.com/dh458)) 
			 * Sudo Fixed a few crashes by catching their errors instead of crashing Minecraft. Seems fair... :D Removed

			 * Removed some console spam, sorry about that. Sometimes debug code sneaks it way into a release.

			v1.6.0 Mod Rewrite Info
			In v1.6.0, CraftPresence has undergone numerous performance and under-the-hood improvements, to both acknowledge user feedback over the last several months and pursue the goal of further modularity.
			As Elements such as the Config System and General RPC Elements have undergone various changes, please report any bugs found to [the Issue Tracker]()
			v1.5.x is Generally Recommended at this time for new users, as the systems used in v1.6.0 may have a variety of issues, and are considered bleeding-edge for the time being
			Migration Notes:

			 * The RPC System has changed to an internal IPC System hooking into Discord's official endpoints

			 * As a result, you can remove any discord-rpc DLL files present in CraftPresence's folders as they are no longer being used 
			 * gameTimePlaceholder is now combined into the &worldinfo& Placeholder

			 * Some of the other placeholders within Server and Status Messages have been changed or renamed, please refer to the in-game tooltips for these new names

			 * Entity Messages now use the Default Message as the Format, while specific Item Messages are considered placeholders for the formatter

			 * This means, only &item& (The Specific Item's Name) will work for specific Items 
			 * Otherwise, the more familiar placeholders such as &main& and &offhand& will retrieve these message when part of the default format setting 
			 * &mods& and &ign& are now Generalized Placeholders and can only be called within the Presence Formatting GUI

			 * &ign& in Server Messages should be changed to using &playerinfo& for in-world Player Data and &ign& for out-of-world Player Data 
			 * overwriteServerIcon has been deprecated, instead use the Presence Formatting GUI to define the priority for icons

			 * Example: overwriteServerIcon = Setting smallImageKey to &PACK&&SERVER& (Having &PACK& be before anything else) 1.13.x Build Info
			The Rift Edition of this Mod Requires the [Rift ModLoader](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/rift) and contains the following differences to take Note of:

			 * KeyCodes have changed from an LWJGL Upgrade! Be Sure to Check and Edit your KeyBinds if Migrating from 1.12.2 and Below Starting In v1.5.0, The 1.13 Rift Port of CraftPresence was deprecated in favor of the 1.13.2 Rift Port
			1.14.x - 1.15.x Build Info
			The 1.14.x and 1.15.x Ports of this Mod Require the [FabricMC ModLoader](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) and contains the same differences as the 1.13.x Port
			Snapshot Build Info
			Some Versions of this Mod are based on Minecraft Snapshots, and as such, caution is advised.
			Any Snapshot Build Released will be marked as BETA to match it's Snapshot Status
			Legacy Build Info (Minecraft Versions 1.5.2 and Below)
			Ports of this Mod for Minecraft Versions 1.5.2 and Lower are on very limited support.
			Please Keep in Mind the Following:

			 * There is NO Support for Server RPC Displays from MC 1.2.5 and Below, due to Modding Limitations. 
			 * Bugs that Relate with or are caused by Issues in the Vanilla CodeBase, are unlikely able to be fixed due to MC's Limitations Please See the Mod Description // README for More Info

			As always, don't forget to backup your world before updating!

			Changes:
			* Improve performance of hasNext in list iterators
			 This used to cause performance issues with nested list concats.
			 Closes #800
			* Don't allow string joining on infinite lists
			Fixes:
			* Use item equality method from CommonCapabilities
			 This fixes issues where NBT tags are configured to be ignored
			 in CommonCaps, but this is not propagated to item comparisons in ID.
			 Closes #795
			* Make NBT representation of battery energy contents unique
			 Integrated Crafting would distinguish between identical batteries
			 obtained through different methods due to unequal NBT,
			 which is fixed by this commit.
			 Closes CyclopsMC/CommonCapabilitiesAPI#8
			* Fix the network diagnostic tool's box rendering
			 - Expand box evenly, not just towards positive x/y/z
			 - Render full block bounding boxes correctly
			* Fix some problems with the network diagnostic tool's click handler
			 - Fix teleporting to full blocks
			 - Prevent additional NullPointerExceptions in click handler. Those occur if you click a row that belongs to another dimension.

			There are different types of interactions which result in different trees, different messages, validators and response options.
			Each response type has:
			One inquiry: The message displayed to the player Response options: Options the player can use to respond Validator: A predicate which checks if the interaction is still valid. At the moment we have two specific types of Interactions:
			StandardInteraction Which has the response options you can see in the top screenshot. It has a validator based on the citizenData only.
			PosBased Same response options but the validator receives besides the citizenData more special data (the pos).
			If a validator requires more information (PoS, ItemStack, Block, ChunkPos, IToken, etc) you setup a new interactionResponseHandler similarly to the PoSBased one and register and set it up in the ModInteractions.
			All these interactions inherit the ServerInteraction (only exists on the server side), the ClientInteraction handler exists only on the client and when triggered it sends a message back to the server to invoke the one on the server side.
			To setup an interaction of the citizen follow the following steps:
			1: Setup a validator and add it to the ModValidators in a static block on top of the class where you use it.
			2: Trigger the interaction in the citizen and reference the validator you used above.
			This is part 1 of this interaction handling. It adds:
			The framework for handling The GUI setup for generic handling. All currently basic citizen interactions. Request System integration Followup Tasks:
			ChitChat status based interactions While testing this I found some bugs and fixed them:
			All furnace based jobs had problems detecting a broken furnace Fisherman had problem with position finding when in water and had problems detecting wrong rods. * hotfix building tool is null issue for 1.12 * hotfix advancement crash * Sleeping guard feature (#4104)

			the enchanter has a GUI where you can set from who he will drain experience
			he will walk to these workers daily and drain some experience (you can set how many levels per day)
			there is a chance of him enchanting randomly something while draining (side effect)
			if he has a high enough experience level he will request enchanted tomes
			he will enchant this tome with a random enchantment, depending on his level, there is a chance to get high level enchantments A few notes a) It is probably one of the nicest workers to watch working b) He takes only 50% of the xp he gains (because he is very skilled) but this percentage is configurable in the config file c) you can configure which books he can produce in the config file as well So, also modded enchantments work
			Also adds potential max, to allow to recruit workers if there is a free space for the guard tower. * Improve/fix some chunk data issues (#4036)

			 * 1.14 fixes (#4002) Respect native workOrder order * Subscriber and colony tick improvements (#3995)
			Changes proposed in this pull request: Feature chunkload Colonies now save the position of claimed chunks which are loaded, which is used to see if the colony is loaded/parts of it are loaded. Feature subscribers In this I've changed the way subscriber adding works, aswell as some internal structure of it.
			Subscribers(players who receive colony views) are no longer constantly pulled from the server's playerlist each tick, instead they're added/removed on chunk enter. Which adds little overhead at all as we're already loading the chunk claim on chunk enter. Those which are added on chunk enter are called/saved as close subscribers, aka subscribers close to the colony.
			In addition we're storing important players with global permissions on login/logoff, those are used for out of colony functionality like keeping the colony active when chunks are loaded, or receiving important messages of stuff happening within the colony like a raider event. Atm owners and officer have those perms.
			Feature Colony Ticks Introduces states to the colony Simplifies ticking logic and makes it about 3x faster Reworked some older ticking logic stuff The basic idea is that states for a colony lets us freely control what the colony updates in each state. For now there are three states:
			Active: All managers /other things updated/tick as usual Unloaded: Only logic which should tick even when the colony chunks are not loaded, requires a player(global subscriber) online for the colony with certain permissions. Inactive: Colony does nothing except occasionally checking if it needs to go into another state. Using the statemachine for this allows us to define transitions for logic which needs to be executed on ticks, simply by choosing in which state it should tick, giving it a function to execute and specifying at which rate we need the updates. Regarding performance this makes our colonies require about three times less tim...

			There are different types of interactions which result in different trees, different messages, validators and response options.
			Each response type has:
			One inquiry: The message displayed to the player Response options: Options the player can use to respond Validator: A predicate which checks if the interaction is still valid. At the moment we have two specific types of Interactions:
			StandardInteraction Which has the response options you can see in the top screenshot. It has a validator based on the citizenData only.
			PosBased Same response options but the validator receives besides the citizenData more special data (the pos).
			If a validator requires more information (PoS, ItemStack, Block, ChunkPos, IToken, etc) you setup a new interactionResponseHandler similarly to the PoSBased one and register and set it up in the ModInteractions.
			All these interactions inherit the ServerInteraction (only exists on the server side), the ClientInteraction handler exists only on the client and when triggered it sends a message back to the server to invoke the one on the server side.
			To setup an interaction of the citizen follow the following steps:
			1: Setup a validator and add it to the ModValidators in a static block on top of the class where you use it.
			2: Trigger the interaction in the citizen and reference the validator you used above.
			This is part 1 of this interaction handling. It adds:
			The framework for handling The GUI setup for generic handling. All currently basic citizen interactions. Request System integration Followup Tasks:

			the enchanter has a GUI where you can set from who he will drain experience
			he will walk to these workers daily and drain some experience (you can set how many levels per day)
			there is a chance of him enchanting randomly something while draining (side effect)
			if he has a high enough experience level he will request enchanted tomes
			he will enchant this tome with a random enchantment, depending on his level, there is a chance to get high level enchantments A few notes a) It is probably one of the nicest workers to watch working b) He takes only 50% of the xp he gains (because he is very skilled) but this percentage is configurable in the config file c) you can configure which books he can produce in the config file as well So, also modded enchantments work

			 * 1.14 fixes (#4002) Respect native workOrder order * Subscriber and colony tick improvements (#3995)
			Changes proposed in this pull request: Feature chunkload Colonies now save the position of claimed chunks which are loaded, which is used to see if the colony is loaded/parts of it are loaded. Feature subscribers In this I've changed the way subscriber adding works, aswell as some internal structure of it.
			Subscribers(players who receive colony views) are no longer constantly pulled from the server's playerlist each tick, instead they're added/removed on chunk enter. Which adds little overhead at all as we're already loading the chunk claim on chunk enter. Those which are added on chunk enter are called/saved as close subscribers, aka subscribers close to the colony.
			In addition we're storing important players with global permissions on login/logoff, those are used for out of colony functionality like keeping the colony active when chunks are loaded, or receiving important messages of stuff happening within the colony like a raider event. Atm owners and officer have those perms.
			Feature Colony Ticks Introduces states to the colony Simplifies ticking logic and makes it about 3x faster Reworked some older ticking logic stuff The basic idea is that states for a colony lets us freely control what the colony updates in each state. For now there are three states:
			Active: All managers /other things updated/tick as usual Unloaded: Only logic which should tick even when the colony chunks are not loaded, requires a player(global subscriber) online for the colony with certain permissions. Inactive: Colony does nothing except occasionally checking if it needs to go into another state. Using the statemachine for this allows us to define transitions for logic which needs to be executed on ticks, simply by choosing in which state it should tick, giving it a function to execute and specifying at which rate we need the updates. Regarding performance this makes our colonies require about three times less tim...
