Peanut Craft 3.4.1 to Peanut Craft 4.0.0

Changelog Generator broken. :(

Updated:

	* Disabled JourneyMap. It's still in, so you can enable it. But recomend to keep it disabled, and use Atlas for greater immersion.
		JourneyMap will be disabled on the official server. At least for the time being.

	* ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
