			 - Fixed a problem with the wireless logic block not correctly sending a block update to the destination block

			 - Tcheinen added comparator functions for the modular storage block. Like vanilla chests it will return 0 when empty, 15 when full, and for all other cases (number of stacks/max stacks) * 14 + 1

			 - Fixed dropping liquid buckets in the fluid opcodes
			 - Small improvement on error logging. The index of the program card that is causing the error is now also printed

			 - Added new 'comment' opcode that acts like a wire but has the extra ability to attach three comment lines. This makes it easier to document your programs
			 - New 'test_eq_item' opcode which is a more flexible way to test for item equality. It can optionally use metadata, NBT, and oredictionary to do the equality test
			 - Fixed a problem where opcodes that work with 'numbers' didn't have access to functions that return integers
			 - The 'eval_tuple' opcode now also has a way to get a tuple from a variable
